### Education Summary

#### High School (2017-2021)

I attended Eagan High School in Eagan, Minnesota, graduating with a **3.16 GPA**. I took 5 honors classes, AP Computer Science (Java), and Mobile Apps Development. After my sophomore year, I completed all my coursework at local colleges through the Minnesota Post-secondary Enrollment Options (PSEO) program.

#### Post-Secondary Enrollment Options (2019-2021)

While in high school, I attended Inver Hills Community College, Normandale Community College, and University of Minnesota Duluth through the PSEO program. I earned 70 college credits with a **3.06 GPA**, completing my _Associate of Arts_ degree before graduating high school.

#### Undergraduate (2021-2024)

I continued my undergraduate studies at the University of Minnesota Duluth and Twin Cities campuses, I am graduating this May with a Bachelor of Science in _Computer Science_ and a minor in _Mathematics_. <!--graduating with a Bachelor of Science in *Computer Science* and a minor in *Mathematics*. I maintained a **3.07 GPA** throughout my studies. -->

#### Graduate (2025+)

I plan to continue my education in Computer Science and Mathematics by pursuing a master's degree program beginning in 2025. While I have not yet definitively selected an institution or finalized my degree plan, my goal is to orient my studies around topics such as:

- Machine learning and artificial intelligence
- Cutting-edge mathematical problems with significant implications for contemporary computing
- AI governance and ethics
- Robotics and autonomous systems
- Advanced algorithms and data structures

In particular, I am intrigued by the intersection of computer science, mathematics, and robotics, and I hope to explore this interdisciplinary space more deeply during my graduate studies.

## Career History

### Relevant Job Experience

#### Other World Computing

Dates: April 2022 - June 2023  
Department: Backend Services  
Positions Held:
- Software Engineer Intern via Maverick Software Consulting (April 2022 - July 2022)
- Software Engineer I (July 2022 - June 2023)

#### University of Minnesota Duluth Gamification and Transportation Lab

Dates: September 2021 - January 2022  
Position: Paid Research Assistant

As a member of a faculty-led research group, I contributed to the development of a mobile game and supporting backend server system. The goal of this research was to test the hypothesis that gamification can intrinsically motivate drivers to adopt safer and more eco-friendly behaviors behind the wheel. Key contributions included:
- Collaborated with a team of undergrad and graduate researchers to ideate ways to gamify the score of a statistical method that calculates a driver's combined safety and eco-friendliness.
- Developed backend services using Node.js and Auth0, including setting up an Apache Cassandra database to manage user accounts, game data, and vehicle telemetry used for the statistical models.
- Configured and maintained a physical server on campus to host the backend services.
- Used Git for version control of both the backend server and mobile game. This supported collaborative development throughout the project and continued development after I left the research team.

#### Caribou Coffee

Dates: September 2023 - June 2024  
Position: Manager On Duty  

Following a period of significant business transformations in my former software engineering role, the demands of my work began to conflict with the increasing workload of my university courses. I made the difficult decision to resign and took a management position at a busy coffee shop to make ends meet while wrapping up my undergraduate program.

I was responsible for overseeing daily operations and managing a small team of 2-3 baristas per shift. Key contributions included:
- Coordinating the work of the team to ensure timely order fulfillment and a positive customer experience.
- Troubleshooting technical issues with the point-of-sale system and coffee equipment.
- Analyzing labor costs, sales data, and inventory levels to optimize profit and product ordering.
- Providing hands-on training to new hires, honing my communication and mentorship skills.
- Translated high-level business goals and seasonal product quotas from management down to my team on the floor.
- Maintaining a welcoming, service-oriented demeanor all while multitasking in a fast-paced, high-stress environment.
