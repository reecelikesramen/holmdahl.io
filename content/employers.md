## Education Summary

### High School (2017 - 2021)
I attended Eagan High School in Eagan, Minnesota, graduating with a **3.16 GPA**. I took 5 honors classes, AP Computer Science (Java), and Mobile Apps Development. After my sophomore year, I completed all my coursework at local colleges through the Minnesota Post-secondary Enrollment Options (PSEO) program.

### Post-Secondary Enrollment Options (2019 - 2021)
While in high school, I attended Inver Hills Community College, Normandale Community College, and University of Minnesota Duluth through the PSEO program. I earned 70 college credits with a **3.06 GPA**, completing my _Associate of Arts_ degree before graduating high school.

### Undergraduate (2021 - 2024)
I continued my undergraduate studies at the University of Minnesota Duluth and Twin Cities campuses, I am graduating this May with a Bachelor of Science in _Computer Science_ and a minor in _Mathematics_. <!--graduating with a Bachelor of Science in *Computer Science* and a minor in *Mathematics*. I maintained a **3.07 GPA** throughout my studies. -->

### Graduate (2025+)
I plan to continue my education in Computer Science and Mathematics by pursuing a master's degree program beginning in 2025. While I have not yet definitively selected an institution or finalized my degree plan, my goal is to orient my studies around topics such as:

- Machine learning and artificial intelligence
- Cutting-edge mathematical problems with significant implications for contemporary computing
- AI governance and ethics
- Robotics and autonomous systems
- Advanced algorithms and data structures

In particular, I am intrigued by the intersection of computer science, mathematics, and robotics, and I hope to explore this interdisciplinary space more deeply during my graduate studies.

#### Jr. Software Engineer (April 2022 - July 2022)
As a Jr. Software Engineer, *(Interning via Maverick Software Consulting)* I worked closely with a small team of software engineers on internal projects to support the finance and operations of the company. While interning I:
- Followed an Agile software development methodology.
- Quickly learned department frameworks and technologies, including:
    - C# and .NET Core for services,
    - React and Blazor for user interfaces,
    - Entity Framework and MS SQL Server for persistence,
    - Git and Bitbucket for version control,
    - Jenkins and Octopus for CI/CD pipeline,
    - Docker and Portainer for containerization,
    - and Elasticsearch and Kibana for monitoring.
- Participated in code reviews and pair programming sessions to improve coding practices.
- Worked remotely during business hours, attending daily standups, weekly lunch & learns, and biweekly sprint retrospectives and sprint planning.
- Praised for communication skills and ability to understand complex technical requirements.

#### Software Engineer I (July 2022 - June 2023)
I took a position as a Software Engineer I after completing several projects as an intern. My performance and communication ability was recognized by the staff engineer, principle engineer, and department manager, and I was offered a full-time position. In this role, I:
- Completed several complex long-term projects with stakeholders from different departments. See [Professional Projects](#professional-projects).
- Refined my skills in estimating time to complete stories and epics.
- Solely responsible for migrating two applications from a legacy ERP solution to Microsoft D365, and jointly responsible with two other coworkers for migrating a different much older and complex application.
- Worked after-hours several times to deploy and monitor applications to production that disrupt user-end services.
- Learned and used standards for quick application bootstrapping: efficiently implementing UI, persistence, auth, logging, and containerizing.
- Assisted the staff engineer in training an intern in their core role responsibilities, including Agile development basics, progress tracking, VCS basics, code testing, and deployment and containerization.
- Attended monthly progress meetings on epics with upper management.

### University of Minnesota Duluth Gamification and Transportation Lab

Position
:   Paid Research Assistant  

Dates
:   September 2021 - January 2022  

#### Job Description
As a member of a faculty-led research group, I contributed to the development of a mobile game and supporting backend server system. The goal of this research was to test the hypothesis that gamification can intrinsically motivate drivers to adopt safer and more eco-friendly behaviors behind the wheel. Key contributions included:
- Collaborated with a team of undergrad and graduate researchers to ideate ways to gamify the score of a statistical method that calculates a driver's combined safety and eco-friendliness.
- Developed backend services using Node.js and Auth0, including setting up an Apache Cassandra database to manage user accounts, game data, and vehicle telemetry used for the statistical models.
- Configured and maintained a physical server on campus to host the backend services.
- Used Git for version control of both the backend server and mobile game. This supported collaborative development throughout the project and continued development after I left the research team.
