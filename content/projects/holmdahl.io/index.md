Key things to highlight when writing:

- Grasped a large and foreign codebase with frameworks that I've never used before in a short period of time
- Solved a popular issue of many users
- Contributed back to the main repo and continuing to support the project
- With help of others, expanding the scope of the app to include more features like MCP integration, Open WebUI instance selection like Slack channel selection, local bundled server and optional Ollama for less technical users
