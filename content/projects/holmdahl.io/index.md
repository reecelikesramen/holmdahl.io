Modern personal portfolio website powered by Hugo and enhanced with Preact, combining the best of static site generation with dynamic interactivity. The site achieves blazing-fast performance through Hugo's static site generation while incorporating interactive elements using Preact and Vite.

**Technologies Used:**

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)
- [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Render](https://render.com/)

**Full project documentation coming soon!**

<!-- Key things to highlight when writing:

- Hugo static site generator
- Preact with Vite for interactivity despite being a static site
- Hooks into google analytics
- Completely free of cost for me because the source code lives in GitHub and Render.com hosts free static sites
- Render.com CI/CD automatically builds and publishes when main changes -->
