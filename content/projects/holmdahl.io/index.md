Key things to highlight when writing:

- Hugo static site generator
- Preact with Vite for interactivity despite being a static site
- Hooks into google analytics
- Completely free of cost for me because the source code lives in GitHub and Render.com hosts free static sites
- Render.com CI/CD automatically builds and publishes when main changes
