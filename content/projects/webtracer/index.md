<!-- Key things to highlight when writing:

- Strong grasp of Rust, a low-level and powerful language
- Implemented complicated mathematical algorithms and optimized them with concurrency using Rayon
- Demonstrated realistic raytracing and physically based rendering
- Incorporated importance sampling, using the ReSTIR technique, significantly speeding up rendering without losing quality
- Incorporated GPU-acceleration with WebGPU
- All dependencies and the project compile to WebAssembly
- Implemented a React interface that allows users to interact with the engine from the browser using a JSON code editor, a live renderer, and asset management. -->
