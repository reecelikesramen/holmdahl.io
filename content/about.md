I'm Reece, a software engineer who discovered coding at age 9 and never looked back. I'm fresh out of the University of Minnesota with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics, and I'm excited to apply myself to things that matter.

# What Drives Me

I enjoy engineering at scale where small details matter and milliseconds make millions. But at the end of the day, I just like solving challenging problems. Robotics, mathematics, AI, and simulations of reality are the things that make me tick. I'm inspired by technology that facilitates digital equity and empowers people to learn, grow, and succeed.

# Away From Keyboard

When I'm not at my computer, you might find me:

- 📝 Crossing national parks off the list
- ☕️ Refining my pourover coffee skills
- 🧗 Trying to get a V10 at the climbing gym this year
- 🏔️ Planning my next adventure (I've lived in 3 states in 2 years!)

Beginning this year, I am also a software mentor for the Eagan High School robotics [team 2220](https://team2220.org). As a former team member, it's incredibly rewarding to inspire and guide the next generation of engineers and problem solvers.

# Looking Forward 🚀

I'm excited to continue growing in tech and hope to explore graduate studies in Robotics, Applied Mathematics, or Machine Learning. I believe in staying curious and embracing new challenges.
