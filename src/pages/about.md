# Hello! 👋

I’m Reece, a software engineer who discovered coding at age 9 and never looked back. I just graduated from the University of Minnesota with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics. I’m excited to apply myself to things that matter.

# What Drives Me

I enjoy engineering at scale where small details matter and milliseconds make millions. But at the end of the day, I just like solving challenging problems. Robotics, mathematics, AI, and simulations of reality are the things that make me tick. I’m inspired by technology that facilitates digital equity and empowers people to learn, grow, and succeed.

# Away From Keyboard

When I’m not at my computer, you might find me:

- 📝 Crossing national parks off the list
- ☕️ Refining my pourover coffee skills
- 🧗 Trying to get a V10 at the climbing gym this year
- 🏔️ Planning my next adventure (I’ve lived in 3 states in 2 years!)

Beginning this year, I am also a software mentor for the Eagan High School robotics team 2220. As a former team member, it’s incredibly rewarding to inspire and guide the next generation of engineers and problem solvers.

# Looking Forward 🚀

I’m charting a course to grow as a software engineer, focusing on building expertise in backend and full-stack development. My immediate goal is honing my craft in API development and scalable software design by taking on projects that challenge me to think architecturally. As I develop professionally, I’m keeping an eye toward graduate studies that compliment my role, or in specialized fields like robotics, AI, or computational physics.
