# Hello, World!

Welcome to my new blog powered by Astro! This is a sample post to test the blog functionality.

## Features

- **Fast**: Built with Astro for optimal performance
- **Simple**: Clean design inspired by PaperMod
- **Markdown**: Write content in Markdown
- **Tags**: Organize posts with tags
- **Responsive**: Looks great on all devices

## Code Example

```js
// This is a sample code block
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

## What's Next?

I plan to write about:

1. Web development
2. Programming tips
3. Tech reviews
4. Personal projects

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!
